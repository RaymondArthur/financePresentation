# Faux Slide Deck: Introductory Finance Presentation
An introductory finance slide deck that I presented to project staff on a project I worked on at the Reserve Bank of Australia.

## The purpose of this app: learning beginner and intermediate ReactJS
The main purpose of this web app is to allow me to learn beginner and intermediate ReactJS.

**The best way to learn is to put theory into practice.**

## The technologies of this app: JavaScript and ReactJS
The technologies for the slide deck app are split into:
1. JavaScript
2. ReactJS

### JavaScript: storing data in JS objects, and exporting these objects via JSON


### ReactJS: building the front-end
By committing to creating a slide deck, this app had me delve into the beginner and intermediate material for ReactJS. ReactJS is a wonderfully flexible front-end framework that allows me to quickly build a web-based UI while having data living within the components that they will be used in.
